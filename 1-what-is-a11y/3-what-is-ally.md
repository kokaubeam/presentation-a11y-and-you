# What is Accessibility (a11y)

**TL;DR:** Providing equal access to information and services.

The design and development of digital products, websites, software, and technology that are inclusive and usable by people with disabilities. It involves ensuring that digital content and interfaces are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for a wide range of users, including those with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, or other impairments. Accessibility practices aim to remove barriers and make technology more equitable and usable for everyone.

## Who should think about accessibility?

- ... front-end, sure! This is where people access information and services. But also...
- ... backend too! Just like l10n and i18n, have to have the data to support the front-end.
- ... UX/Design! Non-sighted users are users. What's their experience like? How should VoiceOver word or announce events on a view?
- ... executives, starts with leadership by example. Don't just mitigate a lawsuit, set the culture and expectations.
- ... architects, builders, family, friends ... everyone that works with or creates for people.

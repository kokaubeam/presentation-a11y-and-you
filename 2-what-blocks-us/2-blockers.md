# A few blockers to consider...

- 🤯 Not having a disability
- 👎🏻 [Weak motivations](../3-why-is-a11y-important/1-weak-motivations.md) 
- 🤷‍♂️ Ignorance: don't know (how to interact with someone with a disability, how to implement a11y), 😱 fear (doing something wrong, making a mistake, of experiencing it ourselves)
- 🏺 Tradition (culture, priorities, code debt, etc.)

🙏🏻 Replace fear with empathy, [weak motivations](../3-why-is-a11y-important/1-weak-motivations.md) with [lasting motivations](../3-why-is-a11y-important/2-lasting-motivations.md), ignorance with knowledge and/or next steps. Change our traditions to **provide equal access to information and services.**

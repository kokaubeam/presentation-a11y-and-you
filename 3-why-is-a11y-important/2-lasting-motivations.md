## Empathy

**TL;DR:** Ability to understand and share the feelings, thoughts, and perspectives of another person.

Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings, thoughts, and perspectives of another person. It involves the capacity to emotionally connect with someone else, **to imagine oneself in their situation,** and to respond with compassion and sensitivity to their emotions and experiences. Empathy enables individuals to better relate to and support others, fostering deeper connections and interpersonal understanding. **It plays a crucial role in building relationships, resolving conflicts, and promoting emotional well-being and social cohesion.**
